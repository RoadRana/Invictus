# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline for a React + Vite application deployed to AWS S3 with CloudFront. The pipeline will automate testing, building, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions, following industry best practices from world-class engineering teams. The system will support multiple environments, automated testing, security scanning, and approval workflows for production deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated CI pipeline that runs on every pull request, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL trigger automated tests, linting, and security scans
2. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks
3. WHEN any CI check fails THEN the system SHALL prevent merging and provide clear feedback
4. WHEN all CI checks pass THEN the system SHALL allow merging and display green status indicators
5. IF the build artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL store them temporarily for review

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a staging environment that automatically deploys from the main branch, so that I can test changes in a production-like environment before releasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
2. WHEN staging deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests against the staging URL
3. WHEN staging tests pass THEN the system SHALL notify the team via configured channels
4. IF staging deployment fails THEN the system SHALL rollback and alert the team
5. WHEN staging is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate CloudFront cache appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want a controlled production deployment process with manual approval, so that I can ensure quality and timing of releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staging deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL create a production deployment request
2. WHEN a production deployment is requested THEN the system SHALL require manual approval from authorized users
3. WHEN production deployment is approved THEN the system SHALL deploy using blue-green or canary strategy
4. WHEN production deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive health checks
5. IF production deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to previous version
6. WHEN production is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate CloudFront cache and verify global propagation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want automated security scanning in the pipeline, so that vulnerabilities are caught before reaching production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
2. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL perform static application security testing (SAST)
3. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL block deployment and provide remediation guidance
4. WHEN secrets are detected in code THEN the system SHALL prevent commit and alert security team
5. IF security scans pass THEN the system SHALL generate security compliance reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the pipeline, so that I can quickly respond to deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any pipeline stage fails THEN the system SHALL send notifications to configured channels (Slack, email, etc.)
2. WHEN deployments complete THEN the system SHALL log detailed metrics and timing information
3. WHEN production issues are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger automated rollback procedures
4. WHEN pipeline performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert the DevOps team
5. IF deployment metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL pause further deployments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration management, so that different environments can have appropriate settings without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from secure secret management systems
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate configuration before deployment
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide validation errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want deployment history and rollback capabilities, so that I can quickly revert problematic releases and maintain system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a complete history with metadata
2. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL support one-click rollback to any previous version
3. WHEN rollback completes THEN the system SHALL verify the previous version is working correctly
4. WHEN deployment artifacts are stored THEN the system SHALL retain them for configurable retention periods
5. IF rollback fails THEN the system SHALL alert the team and provide manual recovery procedures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want automated performance testing in the pipeline, so that performance regressions are caught before affecting users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staging deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run automated performance tests
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL compare against baseline thresholds
3. WHEN performance degrades beyond acceptable limits THEN the system SHALL block production deployment
4. WHEN performance tests pass THEN the system SHALL update performance baselines
5. IF performance testing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance reports and recommendations
